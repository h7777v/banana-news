            <p>These are number lines. It goes from -10 to 10. Notice that when we are going to the right, every time we go over a gap, our number gets bigger by one. The opposite is true when we are going to the left.</p>

                <p>We will write addition and subtraction the normal way now. For instance, starting at 3 and going over 4 gaps while going to the right and getting 7 is written as 3+4=7. Finding the difference of 10 and 3 and getting 7 is written as 10-3=7.</p>
                <p>The difference is just how much bigger or smaller a number is compared to another number. For example: How much bigger is 3 than 1? Can be written as: What is 3-1? You can also understand it like this: Subtraction is like starting with the 1st number and going a certain amount of gaps to the left.</p>

                <p>Let's understand some bigger numbers! First of all, let's understand the tens digit. We write ten as '10'. In a number with 2 numbers, the first number represents how many tens there are in the number, and the second represents how many ones there are. In a one-digit number there is only the digit that represents how many ones there are.</p>

                <h3>No Carrying Needed</h3>
                <p>Now that we understand bigger numbers, let's use them to do simple addition and subtraction!</p>
                <p>Let's first explain 55-5. When we are subtracting a two-digit number by a single-digit number without carrying, we subtract the digits that represent how many ones there are. That is our new ones digit, and we keep our old digit that represents how many tens there are in a number. So, 55-5=50.</p>
                <p>Now, let's explain 55+4. You do the same thing with adding a 2-digit number with a single-digit number without carrying but you add the ones digits instead of subtracting them. So, 55+4=59.</p>

                <p>Skip counting is... you guessed it! Skipping numbers on a number line. For instance, counting by twos is skipping one number every time you count. For example, instead of counting 1,2,3... you would count 2,4,6... because you would skip the '1' on your first count!</p>
