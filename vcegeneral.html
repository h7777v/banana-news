        <h2>Financial Mathematics</h2>
    </div>
    <p>We explore simple and compound interest, depreciation, and loan repayments. These skills help us understand financial decision-making in real-life situations.</p>

    <div class="math-concept">
        <h3>Simple and Compound Interest</h3>
        <p>Simple interest is calculated using the formula <strong>I = P × r × t</strong>, while compound interest uses <strong>A = P(1 + r)^t</strong>. Here, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, and t is time in years.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="math-concept">
        <h3>Linear Models</h3>
        <p>Linear relationships can be represented by equations of the form <strong>y = mx + c</strong>, where m is the gradient and c is the y-intercept. We interpret and apply these models in financial and real-world contexts.</p>

        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
    </div>
    <p>We collect, display, and analyse data using measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and spread (range, IQR, standard deviation).</p>

    <div class="math-concept">
        <h3>Interpreting Data</h3>
        <p>We use statistical displays such as boxplots and histograms to describe data distributions and identify outliers.</p>
