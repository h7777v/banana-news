<h2>About the Banana Method</h2>
<p>The banana method is my way of studying. The first step? Learning content.</p>
<img src="/images/demo.png" height="300">
<p>Both videos and articles are good ways of learning, and it's good to use a mix of both. That's why we use both in our Science pages. Read through some articles, watch the videos, even browse yourself on the internet.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Flashcards</h2>

<caption>I use Anki (above) becauase it has no ads</caption>
<p>Find a flashcard app, install it and put in facts. We have helped you by highlighting in yellow all of our "flash facts", the stuff that is best for you to put into your flashcards. Format: Front of card, the term. Back: The description/defintion of the term</p>
<h2>Step 3: Focusing on your goals</h2>

<p>My goal is competition science, you can find some of the JSO and ASO papers below but you may have your own goals. To achieve these, simply use practice papers/questions.</p>

<p>Remember this three step process!</p>
