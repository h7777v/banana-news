    <h2>Chemistry Overview</h2>
    <p>Chemistry is the study of elements and their interactions. Everything is made of atoms, which have protons which have a positive charge, electrons (negative), and neutrons (neutral). The number of protons equals the number of electrons in a neutral atom.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the Periodic Table</h2>
    <p>The periodic table organizes elements into groups (columns) and periods (rows):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Groups</strong>: Elements in the same group have similar properties. They have the amount of <b>valence</b> electrons as the group number. Valence electrons are the number of electrons in the outer shell.</li>
        <li><strong>Periods</strong>: Elements in the same period have the same number of electron shells.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Isotopes are variants of elements with different numbers of neutrons, often making them unstable and highly reactive.</p>

    <h2>Chemical Bonds</h2>
    <p>Chemical bonds hold atoms together. The main types are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ionic Bonds</strong>: Form when one atom donates an electron to another, creating oppositely charged ions (cations: positive; anions: negative). For example, Sodium (Na) donates an electron to Chlorine (Cl), forming NaCl (table salt).</li>
        <li><strong>Covalent Bonds</strong>: Occur when atoms share electrons. Polar covalent bonds involve unequal sharing (e.g., water, where Oxygen attracts Hydrogen's electrons). Non-polar covalent bonds involve equal sharing (e.g., O₂).</li>
        <li><strong>Metallic Bonds</strong>: Found in metals, where electrons are shared in a "sea" of electrons, allowing conductivity and malleability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The pH Scale</h2>
    <p>The pH scale measures acidity or basicity, ranging from 0 (most acidic) to 14 (most basic), with 7 being neutral. Below is a linear representation of the pH scale with examples:</p>

    <div class="ph-scale">
        <div class="ph-marker" style="left: 0%;">0</div>

<p>Some natural substances can be used as indicators to show pH level. I added baking soda to turmeric solution and it turns from yellow to a darker color, representing high pH. After adding lemon juice, it cancels and turns back to yellow, representing neutral pH.</p>

    <p><strong>Acids</strong>: Substances with a pH below 7, such as battery acid (pH 0), stomach acid (pH 1-2), vinegar (pH 2-3), and lemon juice (pH 2-3).</p>
    <p><strong>Bases</strong>: Substances with a pH above 7, including alkalis (soluble bases) like baking soda (pH 9), ammonia (pH 11), and drain cleaner (pH 14). Bases neutralize acids.</p>
    <p>Metals have free flowing electrons in a rigid base of protons .This means that they can conduct electricity. Many electric vehicles (EVs) use metals like copper and silver for conducting electricity</p>

<h2>Entropy</h2>
<p>Entropy is the "messiness" of things. For example, in a solid, everything is arranged very neatly. This means that the solid has low entropy. However, a gas has things messily moving around everywhere. A gas has high entropy. An example of entropy can be seen with a deck of cards:</p>
<p>The cards are thrown into the air and land on the ground. The neat organised deck has a low entropy, while the messy pile has a high entropy. It takes more energy to go from a state of high to low entropy (put all the cards back together) than the other way (throw the cards in the air)</p>
