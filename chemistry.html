<h2>Chemistry Overview</h2>
    <p>Chemistry is the study of elements and their interactions. Everything is made of <b class="kt">atoms</b>, which have <b class="kt">protons</b> which have a positive charge, <b class="kt">electrons</b> (negative), and <b class="kt">neutrons</b> (neutral). The number of protons equals the number of electrons in a neutral atom.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the <b class="kt">Periodic Table</b></h2>
    <button onclick="displayPd(this)">Show periodic table</button>
    <img src="/images/Periodic_Table.png" style="height:100%;width:100%;display:none;" id="bgTable">
    <p>The periodic table organizes <b class="kt">elements</b> into <b class="kt">groups</b> (columns) and <b class="kt">periods</b> (rows):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Groups</strong>: Elements in the same group have similar properties. They have the amount of <b class="kt">valence</b> electrons as the group number. Valence electrons are the number of electrons in the outer shell.</li>
        <li><strong>Periods</strong>: Elements in the same period have the same number of electron shells.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="science-div">
    <p><b class="kt">Isotopes</b> are variants of elements with different numbers of neutrons, often making them unstable and highly reactive.</p>
</div><div class="science-div"><h2>Chemical Bonds</h2>
    <p>Chemical bonds hold atoms together. The main types are:</p>
    <img src="/images/Ionic-Bond-Definition-and-Example.png" height="200">
    <p>Ionic bond</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong class="kt">Ionic Bonds</strong>: Form when one atom donates an electron to another, creating oppositely charged ions (cations: positive; anions: negative). For example, Sodium (Na) donates an electron to Chlorine (Cl), forming NaCl (table salt).</li>
        <li><strong class="kt">Covalent Bonds</strong>: Occur when atoms share electrons. Polar covalent bonds involve unequal sharing (e.g., water, where Oxygen attracts Hydrogen's electrons). Non-polar covalent bonds involve equal sharing (e.g., O₂).</li>
        <li><strong class="kt">Metallic Bonds</strong>: Found in metals, where electrons are shared in a "sea" of electrons, allowing conductivity and malleability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well how are these formed? As you probably know, protons tug on electrons like the positive/negative ends of a magnet. The strength of this tug is <b class="kt">electronegativity</b>. If you have an electronegativity of about 1.7, you get an Ionic bond (one electron gets donated), whereas if it's lower than 0.5 you get a <b class="kt">Nonpolar covalent bond</b> Which means that they have about equal pull and the electrons don't really belong to anyone.</p></div>
<div class="science-div">

     <h2>The <b class="kt">pH Scale</b></h2>
     <p>When water gains a proton, you get a <b class="kt">Hydronium Ion</b> (H+). (Which is an Ionic bond, refer to above). More acidic = higher concentration of hydronium ions. </p>
     <p><b class="kt">Acids</b> contain lots of hydronium ions, and they are the donors, meaning they donate a proton (H+) to <b class="kt">bases</b>. (H-) for acids. <b class="kt">Alkalis</b> are just soluble bases, like baking soda.</p>
    <p>The pH scale measures acidity or basicity, ranging from 0 (most acidic) to 14 (most basic), with 7 being neutral. Below is a linear representation of the pH scale with examples:</p>
<p>Some substances are <b class="kt">Amphoteric</b>, which means that they can be both an acid and a base, like water. (Water is just better, it dissolves lots of stuff and can be an acid or base)</p>

<p>Some natural substances can be used as <b class="kt">indicators</b> to show pH level. I added baking soda to turmeric solution (I have no red cabbage) and it turns from yellow to a darker color, representing high pH. After adding lemon juice, it cancels and turns back to yellow, representing neutral pH.</p>

    <p><strong>Acids</strong>: Substances with a pH below 7, such as battery acid (pH 0), stomach acid (pH 1-2), vinegar (pH 2-3), and lemon juice (pH 2-3).</p>
    <p><strong>Bases</strong>: Substances with a pH above 7, including alkalis (soluble bases) like baking soda (pH 9), ammonia (pH 11), and drain cleaner (pH 14). Bases neutralize acids.</p>

<p>Metals have free flowing electrons in a rigid base of protons .This means that they can conduct electricity. Many electric vehicles (EVs) use metals like copper and silver for conducting electricity</p>

    <h2>Entropy</h2>
<p>Entropy is the "messiness" of things. For example, in a solid, everything is arranged very neatly. This means that the solid has low entropy. However, a gas has things messily moving around everywhere. A gas has high entropy. An example of entropy can be seen with a deck of cards:</p>
<p>The cards are thrown into the air and land on the ground. The neat organised deck has a low entropy, while the messy pile has a high entropy. It takes more energy to go from a state of high to low entropy (put all the cards back together) than the other way (throw the cards in the air)</p>
