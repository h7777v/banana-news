<h2>Chemistry Overview</h2>
    <p>Chemistry is the study of elements and their interactions. Everything is made of <b class="kt">atoms</b>, which have <b class="kt">protons</b> which have a positive charge, <b class="kt">electrons</b> (negative), and <b class="kt">neutrons</b> (neutral). The number of protons equals the number of electrons in a neutral atom.</p>

<h2>The levels of Classification (Animalia and Plantae)</h2>
<p>There are 8 levels of classification however today we will</p>
<p>focus on the 7 main ones. To remember them there is a simple acronym listed</p>
<p>below:</p>
<p> <b class='kt'>King Philip Came Over From Great Spain</b></p>
<p>Using the following acronyms, we can convert them to the 7 classifications:</p>
<p> <b class='kt'>Kingdom Phylum Class Order Family Gensis Species</b></p>
<p>Now I will explain each classification starting with kingdom.</p>
<p>There are 5 different classifications within the large rangeof kingdom, these 5 classifications are, <b class='kt'> Animalia, Plantae, Monera, Fungi, Protista</b>.Let’s first talk about the Animalia in the kingdom. In in consists of 5 main classesand 3 subclasses. The 5 main classes are, <b class='kt'> Reptiles, Amphibians, Mammals, Aves(birds) and Fish</b>. With the 3 sub classes for Mammals being <b class='kt'>Marsupials, Placentalsand Monotremes</b>, with Marsupials meaning that you give birth to young inside apouch such as kangaroos. Humans are Placentals, being born in the uterus and beingfed milk. The last one is Monotremes which means being born in eggs. Plantae isalso split into 2 categories, a <b class='kt'>Conifer</b> and a <b class='kt'>Flowering plant. </b> Howevermore scientifically they are split into 4 categories which are <b class='kt'>bryophytes(non-vascular plants like mosses), pteridophytes (seedless vascular plants likeferns), gymnosperms (cone-bearing seed plants), and angiosperms (flowering plants)</b>. <b class='kt'>Bryophytes are non-vascular plants meaning they don’t have the tissuesthat support them transferring water and nutrients throughout their body. </b> <b class='kt'>Anexample of Bryophytes are mosses, liverworts and hornworts. </b> Pteridophytesare seedless vascular plants that have most tissues, they reproduce mainlyusing spores rather than seeds. <b class='kt'> An example of a Pteridophytes is ferns andhorsetails. A gymnosperm is a cone bearing seed plant that produces seedsrather than flowers, the term gymnosperm literally translates to “naked plant.”A example of gymnosperm are Cycads, Pines and Conifers. The last one is angiosperms,which are a type of flowering plant with the most diverse group, they produceseeds enclosed with a fruit. And example of a angiosperms are rice, corn banana and mangos. </b></p>

    <h2><b class="kt">Chemical Bonding</b></h2>
<p>Before you start to understand Chemical bonding, you will need to understand the structure and the components of an atom. An atom is made from the centre being a <b class='kt'>nucleus</b> which is mostly made up of <b class='kt'>protons</b> (upper / positive charge) and <b class='kt'>neurons</b> (no charge). <b class='kt'>The outer layer</b> is surrounded by tiny electrons that forms into clouds and orbits around the nucleus in shells. Chemical bonding is the <b class='kt'>force that holds the components of that of an atom</b>, this creates a molecule further creating a compound. There are some types of Chemical bonds such as <b class='kt'>ionic bonds</b>, where a bond is formed by the electrostatic interconnection between opposite ions. This happens when an atom transfers all its electrons to another. <b class='kt'>Covalent bonds</b> is a chemical bond, that forms by the sharing of electron pairs between atoms to create a more stable and balanced electron configuration. <b class='kt'>Metallic bonds</b>, which is where <b class='kt'>positive metallic ions</b> are held together by a lot of delocalised electrons. Some weaker bonds between atoms and molecules include the <b class='kt'>hydrogen bond</b>, where a strong attraction happens when a hydrogen atom bonds into an electronegative atom. A simple example of this is observed with <b class='kt'>nitrogen, fluorine and oxygen</b>. These are all attracted to different or nearby <b class='kt'>electronegative molecules</b>. </p>

    <h2>Understanding the <b class="kt">Periodic Table</b></h2>
    <button onclick="displayPd(this)">Show periodic table</button>
    <img src="/images/Periodic_Table.png" style="height:100%;width:100%;display:none;" id="bgTable">
    <p>The periodic table organizes <b class="kt">elements</b> into <b class="kt">groups</b> (columns) and <b class="kt">periods</b> (rows):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Groups</strong>: Elements in the same group have similar properties. They have the amount of <b class="kt">valence</b> electrons as the group number. Valence electrons are the number of electrons in the outer shell.</li>
        <li><strong>Periods</strong>: Elements in the same period have the same number of electron shells.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="science-div">
    <p><b class="kt">Isotopes</b> are variants of elements with different numbers of neutrons, often making them unstable and highly reactive.</p>
    <p><b class="kt">Isomers</b> are not even too related but I'll talk about them now. Basically, the chemical notation like H20 is good for telling us exactly what there is. Unfortunately, it can't tell us the arrangement. Isomers are  a compound where the elements and numbers are the same but the arrangement is different.</p>
    <p>Oh, and by the way, <b class="kt">Allotropes</b> are the same element, but with a different structure, making them totally different. Graphite, is really the same as diamonds. It's just carbon.</p>

</div><div class="science-div"><h2>Chemical Bonds</h2>
    <p>Chemical bonds hold atoms together. The main types are:</p>
    <img src="/images/Ionic-Bond-Definition-and-Example.png" height="200">
    <p>Ionic bond</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong class="kt">Ionic Bonds</strong>: Form when one atom donates an electron to another, creating oppositely charged ions (cations: positive; anions: negative). For example, Sodium (Na) donates an electron to Chlorine (Cl), forming NaCl (table salt).</li>
        <li><strong class="kt">Covalent Bonds</strong>: Occur when atoms share electrons. Polar covalent bonds involve unequal sharing (e.g., water, where Oxygen attracts Hydrogen's electrons). Non-polar covalent bonds involve equal sharing (e.g., O₂).</li>
        <li><strong class="kt">Metallic Bonds</strong>: Found in metals, where electrons are shared in a "sea" of electrons, allowing conductivity and malleability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well how are these formed? As you probably know, protons tug on electrons like the positive/negative ends of a magnet. The strength of this tug is <b class="kt">electronegativity</b>. If you have an electronegativity greater than about 1.7, you get an Ionic bond (one electron gets donated), whereas if it's lower than 0.5 you get a <b class="kt">Nonpolar covalent bond</b> Which means that they have about equal pull and the electrons don't really belong to anyone.</p></div>
<div class="science-div">

     <h2>The <b class="kt">pH Scale</b></h2>
     <p>When water gains a proton, you get a <b class="kt">Hydronium Ion</b> (H+). (Which is an Ionic bond, refer to above). More acidic = higher concentration of hydronium ions. </p>
     <p><b class="kt">Acids</b> contain lots of hydronium ions, and they are the donors, meaning they donate a proton (H+) to <b class="kt">bases</b>. (H-) for acids. <b class="kt">Alkalis</b> are just soluble bases, like baking soda.</p>
    <p>The pH scale measures acidity or basicity, ranging from 0 (most acidic) to 14 (most basic), with 7 being neutral. Below is a linear representation of the pH scale with examples:</p>
<p>Some substances are <b class="kt">Amphoteric</b>, which means that they can be both an acid and a base, like water. (Water is just better, it dissolves lots of stuff and can be an acid or base)</p>

<p>Some natural substances can be used as <b class="kt">indicators</b> to show pH level. I added baking soda to turmeric solution (I have no red cabbage) and it turns from yellow to a darker color, representing high pH. After adding lemon juice, it cancels and turns back to yellow, representing neutral pH.</p>

    <p><strong>Acids</strong>: Substances with a pH below 7, such as battery acid (pH 0), stomach acid (pH 1-2), vinegar (pH 2-3), and lemon juice (pH 2-3).</p>
    <p><strong>Bases</strong>: Substances with a pH above 7, including alkalis (soluble bases) like baking soda (pH 9), ammonia (pH 11), and drain cleaner (pH 14). Bases neutralize acids.</p>

<p>Metals have free flowing electrons in a rigid base of protons .This means that they can conduct electricity. Many electric vehicles (EVs) use metals like copper and silver for conducting electricity</p>

    <p>Oh and by the way, there's lots of inter atomic forces. My favorite is <b class="kt">Van der Waals force</b>. What happens is, when electrons, by chance, end up on one side of an atom, they influence electrons in other atoms to also become a <b class="kt">Dipole</b>. But then they keep moving and it is gone.</p>

   <div class="science-div">
    <h2>Entropy</h2>
<p><b class="kt">Entropy</b> is the "messiness" of things. For example, in a solid, everything is arranged very neatly. This means that the solid has low entropy. However, a gas has things messily moving around everywhere. A gas has high entropy. An example of entropy can be seen with a deck of cards:</p>
<p>The cards are thrown into the air and land on the ground. The neat organised deck has a low entropy, while the messy pile has a high entropy. It takes more energy to go from a state of high to low entropy (put all the cards back together) than the other way (throw the cards in the air)</p>
