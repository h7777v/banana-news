<h1>Biology</h1>
<h2><b class="kt">This is a key term. It means that you should put it in your flashcards!</b></h2>

<p>Biology is life. Every form of life is made out of <b class="kt">cells</b>. There are 2 main types of cells: Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes. Prokaryotes are Cells have a very important thing called enzymes. Basically, enzymes break up or put together different chemicals. This is very important: Each type of enzyme can only deal with a specific type of chemical. They also need a specific environment. <b>Homeostatis</b> is the process that cells use to control things, like the pH level in the cell (see Chemistry for pH. Yes, Biology is just Chemistry). To do this, each cell has a <b>semi-permeable</b> membrane. Small things like oxygen and water can just pass through the membrane, but larger things need to be let through a sort of door that allows things in and out. Naturally, things flow from a place of higher concentration to a place of lower concentration. Water can also flow to a place of higher solute concentration. To flow the other way, you need energy. This energy is called ATP.</p>
<p>How do cells get <b class="kt">ATP</b>? Well, animals eat food, which gives them sugar, which has glucose, which added to oxygen can be converted into water, carbon dioxide and ATP. Plants, however, have things called Chloroplasts. Inside the Chloroplast, there's Chlorophyll. These reflect green light (so plants are green) and absorb red and blue light. This light is used to break down water and get carbon dioxide that can be converted to glucose.</p>

<h2>Evolution:</h2>
<p>Charles darwin invented natural selection (but he actually had lots of help from Wallace). The theory is simple. Animals better adapted to new change are going to survive and produce offspring. The variations in animals can happen naturally by accident.</p>

    <h2><b class="kt">Ecology</b></h2>
    <p>A big part of biology, this section is to introduce you to some simple features</p>
    </div>
    <div class="science-div">
    <p>Biotic and abiotic - The rock is abiotic. The plant is biotic. Biotic means Living, and Abiotic means not living</p>

    <p>A population is a group of the same species in a certain area. A community is a group of populations in a certain area. An ecosystem is a group of biotic and abiotic factors which form a system. A biome is a large area with similar climate/physical features that define it.</p>

    <p><b class="kt">Competition</b> can be inter (between different species) or intra (between same species) specific. It is bad for both individuals (--). <b class="kt">Symbiosis</b> is a long term relationship between two animals. It includes parasitism, commensalism and mutualism. <b class="kt">Parasitism</b> is good for one, bad for the other (+-), <b class="kt">commensalism</b> is good for one and neutral for other (+0), while <b class="kt">mutualism</b> is good for both (++). <b class="kt">Predation</b> is good for predator, bad for prey (+-), which is the same as <b class="kt">herbivory</b> (+-)</p>

    <h2>Behaviour</h2>
    <p>We've got to my favorite part of biolgy! Animal behaviour. After observing birds in the breeding season for Australia, I have made some discoveries.</p>
    <p>Parasitism</p>
    <p>We talked about parasitism earlier, so you should know what it is. One day, I saw a Channel-billed Cuckoo out the window, so I followed it. It was being chased by many other birds, such as Little Ravens, Australian Magpies and Noisy Miners. The reason for this is that it is a <b class="kt">Brood Parasite</b>, which means that it lays its eggs in other birds nests, so that they will bring up its babies for them. After tracking birds nests for a while, I have now found 5 nests, with the Little Raven nests being most likely for the Cuckoo's baby to be in. Keep checking back for updates, at around the end of this October!</p>
