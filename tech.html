  <h3>2025 iPhone lineup</h3>
  
  <img src="/images/Samsung S25 series.jpg" alt="The 2025 Samsung lineup" height="400px" width="685px">
  <p>The Samsung lineup of 2025 is certainly interesting. Firstly, a Galaxy S25 FE is coming soon in place of the S24 FE. It, however, is very practical and sufficient for most users. The S25 is a solid base model. The Edge is certainly interesting, but its battery life and cameras are questionable. The S25+ is overpriced. The S25 Ultra is decent.

  <h3>2025 iPhone lineup</h3>
  
  <img src="/images/iphone 17 lineup.jpg" alt="The 2025 iPhone lineup" height="400px" width="685px">
  <p>The iPhone lineup of 2025 is certainly interesting. Firstly, we get an iPhone 16e in place of the SE, which is unfortunately overpriced at $599 USD. However, this phone is still the most popular, because it is very practical and sufficient for most users. The iPhone 17 is the best base model we have seen in years, with a 120hz LTPO ProMotion display, 18MP Center Stage front camera, A19 Chip and 6.3" display size. Furthermore, it now starts at 256GB storage, which is excellent because this is more in line with the requirements of a flagship phone owner. The Air is certainly interesting, but its price, battery life, and <b>single</b> camera make it unsuitable for most users. The pro phones are focusing on function this year, with a body that is mostly aluminum for better heat conductivity, and, for the first time, a vapor chamber cooling system. Another excellent feature is the camera system, with an 18MP Center Stage front camera and 3x48MP rear camera system.</p>

  <h3>iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro</h3>
  
  <img src="/images/image.jpeg" alt="The iPhone 16 and 16 Pro" height="400px" width="685px">
  <p>The new iPhones are here. Both models get a new Camera Control slider and the Action Button, although the Action button was already on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. The regular iPhone 16s also have a new camera layout and Apple Intelligence (Apple Intelligence used to be exclusive to the 15 Pro and Pro Max), while the iPhone 16 Pros still has Apple Inteligence, and a new 48MP ultrawide camera. The iPhone 16 and 16 Pro have also recieved some other very minor features that are completely irrelevant to most people.</p>

<h3>Huawei</h3>

<img src="/images/mate60.png" alt="The huawei regular mate 60" height="200px">
<p>Really, the only Huawei phones anyone should buy are the Mate 60 Pro and Mate 60, due to their 5G and good values.</p>

<h3>OnePlus</h3>

<img src="/images/oneplus 12r.png" alt="The Oneplus 12R" height="400px">
<p>For OnePlus, either buy the OnePlus 12R (Known as the Ace 3 in China) or OnePlus 12 for their good specifications and resonable price. Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for the 12R, 8 Gen 3 for the 12, Aqua touch, and an advanced cooling system (plus 120hz for buth phones and good cameras on the 12 but not on the 12R) for 2400-5800 Yuan (and up to 16GB of ram for 12R and 24GB for 12) is perfect. </p></div>
<br><div class="newsdiv"><img src="/images/realme copy.jpg" alt="The Realme GT5 Pro" height="400px" >

<h3>Realme</h3>
<p>Realme provides great value options, like the GT5 Pro, but there are some drawbacks on the GT5 pro, such as the horrible 8MP ultra-wide camera. However, it has the lateset Snapdragon 8 gen 3, up to 16GB RAM and 1TB storage, and has a 144hz LTPO display. The 1TB version only costs 4299 chinese yuan, which is about 900-1000 AUD. So, if you don't care about cameras, the GT5 Pro is a good option.  </p>

<img src="/images/oppo.jpeg" alt="The Oppo Find X7 Ultra" height="400px" >
<h3>Oppo</h3>
<p>Just buy the Find X7 Ultra. It is the only OPPO-branded phone to have the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, but its main selling point are the cameras. Quad 50-MP camera system plus partership with Hasselblad = the best of the best. Sure, it is not too cheap, but it is at least cheaper than many iPhones and Samsung phones. And if you want the best phone camera there is, the Oppo Find X7 Ultra is a great option.</p>

<div class="newsdiv">
<h3>Vivo</h3>

<p>Forget about Vivo. They use MediaTek chips for their flagship phones, which suck. Just use a Qualcomm chip and I'll consider Vivo, but they are using MediaTek.

<h3>iQOO</h3>
<p>Only get the iQOO 12 and iQOO 12 Pro. Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, good cameras, great.</p>
</div><br><div class="newsdiv">
<h3>Forget about Samsung. They are just much too expensive. Really, you should only get apple for the Apple ecosystem, and there are NO reasons for buying Samsung.</h3>

<h2>Tablets</h2>

<p>Only buy iPads. Android tablets are simply not as good. And for iPads, we recommend the iPad 10th Gen, Air or Pro models.</p>

<h2>iPad buyer's guide, mid 2024</h2>
<p>With the arrival of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air, many people are once again faced with the challenge of which iPad to buy. Well, here is the complete buyer's guide.</p><br><h3>iPad Pro and Air:</h3><p> If you want the very best of the best iPad for everything, we would recommend the <i>smaller</i> iPad Pro, because the larger one is simply pathetic in terms of durability. However, you definitely won't need it, which is why we recommend the iPad Air for most users, pros or not. For the iPad Air, it is fine to go with the larger option.</p> <h3>iPad 10 and mini</h3><p>Wait for the iPad 11, whether it's to get a newer iPad or to get the older iPad 10 for a potentially cheaper price. And you should definetly wait for the next iPad Mini.</p>
</div><br><div class="newsdiv"><h2>Laptops</h2>
<p>Lenovo is obviously the best, but if you want to be boring then you can get a HP laptop. If you want to be cheap, go for a DELL chromebook. (Be warned: Chromebooks are terrible). And only get a Mac if you want to do video editing or like the Apple ecosystem. Also, make sure to always get an AMD computer, never Intel for Windows.</p>
</div><br>
<div class="newsdiv">
<h2>Kirin 9000S</h2>
<img src="/images/kirin.jpg">
<p>Huawei's own Kirin 9000S is the chip used in the Huawei Mate 60 series. It is not too fast compared to Snapdragon at the moment, but will get a lot faster in the future. If you would like to support the Chinese tech industry and help defeat the bullying and unfair play by the United States, get a Mate 60/Pro/Pro+.</p>
